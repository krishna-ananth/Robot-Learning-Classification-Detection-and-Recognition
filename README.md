# Robot-Learning-Classification-Detection-and-Recognition
The aim of this project is to use algorithms that can be used towards robotic grasping and manipulation. This project is divided into three parts, namely Classification, Detection, and Recognition.Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), K-means clustering algorithm, and Support Vector Machines have been used to tackle the problems at hand.
