# Robot-Learning-Classification-Detection-and-Recognition
The aim of this project is to use algorithms that can be used towards robotic grasping and manipulation. This project is divided into three parts, namely Classification, Detection, and Recognition. All these parts have been tackled with the algorithms which I thought would best suit the problem at hand.
